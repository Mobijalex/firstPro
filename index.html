          <h2>The first avenger</h2>
          <p1>
            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist,
            inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark
            suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors
            attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he
            instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and
            escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and
            other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
            Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the
            world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity,
            Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.
